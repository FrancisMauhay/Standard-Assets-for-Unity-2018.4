# Standard-Assets-for-Unity-2018.4
Unity took down their download for the 2018 Standard Assets, without providing an archive download. 

I think this is ridiculous, as they can still be found useful. 

I am hosting the unitypackage here for download under releases. 

Here is the original link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-2018-4-check-out-starter-assets-first-person-thi-32351

If Unity ever offers it for download officially, I will remove this repository.
