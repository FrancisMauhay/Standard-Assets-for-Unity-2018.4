# Standard-Assets-for-Unity-2018.4
Unity took down their download for the 2018 Standard Assets, without providing an archive download. 
I think this is ridiculous, as they can still be found useful. 
I am hosting the unitypackage here for download under releases.

If Unity ever offers it for download officially, I will remove this repository.
